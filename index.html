  Hi, this is <a href="https://twitter.com/mrtnkl">Martin</a> from <a href="https://www.q42.nl/en/">Q42</a>. Quite a few years ago, my old-school-adventure-game-heroes Scott Murphy and Mark Crowe of Space Quest fame decided to do a Kickstarter for their new adventure game: <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spaceventure/two-guys-spaceventure-by-the-creators-of-space-que">Space Venture</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Being a fan of adventure games I once made <a href="http://sarien.net/">sarien.net</a>, a place to replay old classics such as Space Quest, Police Quest, King's Quest and more, right in the browser, with added multiplayer. And so I thought Space Venture could be made using HTML5...
</p>
<p>
  To convice the Two Guys that it can be done, I made a little demo called <a href="https://monolithburgerboy.q42games.com/">Monolith Burger Boy</a>, sent them the link and got a very positive response! As Q42, we decided to help them during the Kickstarter phase in creating HTML5 SpaceVenture concept demos and see how to go from there.
</p>
<p>
  Together with my colleague (and fellow Space Quest fan) <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahulchoudhury/">Rahul Choudhury</a> we started working on these prototypes. We wrote <a href="https://blog.q42.nl/space-quest-42-dab8c636ab33/">a (Dutch) blogpost</a> about the collaboration and we started working together on the first HTML5 prototype, iterating into the second, followed by a phase 3, 4 and 5. We even worked on a little AGI fun demo but never got to fully finalize it.
</p>
<p>
  In the end, the decision was made not to use HTML5 for the actual SpaceVenture Game. We all supported that direction and we had fun nonetheless. Below are all the demos for you to enjoy.
</p>
<p>
  Have fun,<br><br>
